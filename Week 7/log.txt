I first use 

	$ dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh

to check whether both server and client are installed
then I got the output that 

	openssh-client					install

which means I still need to install server part
so then I 

	$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server

and after that, I run the prior command again, and got

	openssh-client					install
	openssh-server					install
	openssh-sftp-server				install


For the SERVER part:
first I use 

	$ ssh-keygen

to generate my public and private keys, and saved them at default addressm and set empty as the passphrase
next, I runt the command

	$ sudo useradd –d /home/35l –m zhouyang

to create an account for the client on the server, in the name of my lab partner
and then set the initial password

	$ sudo passwd zhouyang

then I create .ssh new directory for the client

	$ cd /home/35l
	$ sudo mkdir .ssh

then I change ownership and permission on .ssh directory

	$ sudo chown –R zhouyang .ssh
	$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh

then I want to use emacs to disable password-based authentication

	$ emcas /etc/ssh/sshd_config

but then I find out I need to install emacs at first

	$ sudo apt install emacs24

and after that

	$ emcas /etc/ssh/sshd_config

and change PasswordAuthentication from yes to no
I use 

	$ ifconfig

to see my IP address, which is 10.97.85.138.
here my SERVER part is done.

For the CLIENT part:
first I use

	$ ssh-keygen

to generate my public and private keys
then I copy my public key to the server for key-based authentication

	$ ssh-copy-id –i zhouyang@10.97.85.138

then I add private key to authentication agent

	$ ssh-add

and then initialize SSH to server

	$ ssh –X zhouyang@10.97.85.138

and then I run a command on the remote host

	$ firefox

here my CLIENT part is done.

To verify the successful two-way relation
I use the command 

	$ ps aux | grep firefox

to see all the running processes on the server related to firefox
and I get the output of

	zhouyang 8262 16.8 2.2 626852 184092 pts/2 sl+ 13:16 0:03 /usr/lib/firefox/firefox

which means I am good.

After that, my partner and I do a vice-versa job that we change each other's role.
With similar command and similar output, we succeed again. 
What a beautiful day.
